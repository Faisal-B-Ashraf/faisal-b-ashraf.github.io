title: "Non-powered Dam Development Opportunities"
excerpt: "Although more than 92,000 dams are scattered across the United States, the vast majority — over 89,000 — do not generate electricity through hydropower. Researchers at the US Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) are assessing the feasibility of retrofitting some of these non-powered dams (NPDs) to potentially generate enough clean energy to add 12 gigawatts of electricity to the U.S. power grid."
