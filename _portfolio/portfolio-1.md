title: "Gridless Solutions"
excerpt: "Providing access to basic services such as electricity, sanitation and freshwater is a key challenge in settings and societies that are geographically isolated, in conflict zones and in nations with fragile societal institutions. Finding approaches to develop and scale deployment of decentralized “gridless” technologies to fill this gap, is crucial to accelerate fulfilment of the Paris Agreement and the SDGs."
